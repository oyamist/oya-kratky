# Hydro Bed

Built to last for decades, this south-facing raised bed for 
hydroponic planter buckets is sturdy and 
shields the buckets from the heat of direct sun. The raised bed is up and
away from slugs and snails. The extra height also helps with pruning and
harvesting.

the boards.

* Place FRONT2 and BACK2 rails to side of top layer
* Evenly space BOTTOM1-4 across TOP1-5 at 16" center-to-center as bottom joists between FRONT2 and BACK2 rails
* Fasten joist hangers using deck screws. 

### Assemble Bed
With a friend, assemble bed using screws provided with corners. 
Do it by yourself if brave.

### Add Pipe Frame
The PVC Pipe frame can be used for shade cloth, solar panels and support string.
Fasten PVC pipes to inside corners using wood scraps or brackets.
Top with corners and remaining pipe cut to desired length.
